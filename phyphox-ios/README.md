# Data Collection Description

## Collection Method
The dataset contains accelerometer data collected using the Phyphox application on an iOS iPhone. The data was captured without gravity (g) meaning that the accelerometer data provided by this option only represents the acceleration experienced by the device in a particular direction, excluding the gravitational acceleration acting on the device. The timestamps in the dataset are not constant, as data was written only when participants made movements on their hips or legs. This resulted in timestamps being irregular, occurring only when significant movements were detected.

## Participant Duration
The dataset includes data from 20 participants, each identified as P1 to P20. The duration of data collected from each participant varies based on their movements. The data was recorded from two pockets, left and right, on the participants' clothing. It is important to note that the durations of data collected from the left and right pockets may not always be equal. This discrepancy in duration occurs because the data recording was manually stopped by the tester after the actions or movements being recorded ceased. Therefore, there may be differences in the durations of data collected from the left and right pockets, even for the same participant (P).
